With a strong academic foundation in STEM, I have complemented my studies with multiple internships, gaining hands-on experience in real-world environments. I have been passionate about programming for the past 2â€“3 years, consistently building and refining my coding skills through personal projects, online courses, and participation in tech-related initiatives.</p>
